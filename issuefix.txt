Installation and Dependency Management

To install and set up the ChatGPT AI-powered software development program, follow these steps:

    Clone or download the program repository from the project's GitHub page.

    Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

    Create a virtual environment to isolate the program's dependencies using the following command:

python3 -m venv myenv

Activate the virtual environment. In Linux, use the command:

bash

source myenv/bin/activate



Troubleshooting and Error Resolution

    If you encounter an error related to the Flask module, ensure that Flask is installed in your virtual environment. You can install Flask using the command pip install flask.

    If the error persists, check if you have activated the virtual environment correctly before running the program.

    If you receive an API-related error, ensure that you have obtained a valid API key from OpenAI and configured it correctly in the program. Double-check the API key and make sure it is correctly assigned to the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

    If the issue persists, review the OpenAI API documentation and troubleshooting guides for further assistance.

    Additionally, ensure that you have an active internet connection to communicate with the OpenAI API.
